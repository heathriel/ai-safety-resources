# Model Governance Guidelines

## 1. Versioning
- **Practice:**  
  - Implement a robust version control system for AI models to track changes, updates, and iterations.
- **Action Steps:**  
  - Assign unique version identifiers to each model release.
  - Maintain detailed documentation of changes, including data used, training parameters, and performance metrics.

## 2. Change Management
- **Practice:**  
  - Establish formal procedures for managing modifications to AI models, ensuring systematic evaluation and approval.
- **Action Steps:**  
  - Develop a change request process requiring justification and impact analysis.
  - Involve a cross-functional review team to assess proposed changes.

## 3. Access Control
- **Practice:**  
  - Restrict access to AI models and related data to authorized personnel to maintain security and integrity.
- **Action Steps:**  
  - Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) to define user permissions.
  - Regularly audit access logs to detect and respond to unauthorized activities.

## 4. Incident Response
- **Practice:**  
  - Develop a comprehensive incident response plan to address issues arising from AI model deployment.
- **Action Steps:**  
  - Define potential incident scenarios and corresponding response strategies.
  - Establish communication protocols for internal and external stakeholders during incidents.

## 5. Performance Monitoring
- **Practice:**  
  - Continuously monitor AI models to ensure they meet performance standards and operate within acceptable parameters.
- **Action Steps:**  
  - Set up automated monitoring tools to track key performance indicators (KPIs).
  - Schedule regular performance reviews to assess model efficacy and identify areas for improvement.

## 6. Documentation
- **Practice:**  
  - Maintain comprehensive documentation for each AI model, detailing its development, deployment, and operational history.
- **Action Steps:**  
  - Create standardized templates for model documentation.
  - Update documentation promptly following any changes or updates to the model.

## 7. Ethical Considerations
- **Practice:**  
  - Integrate ethical guidelines into the AI model development and deployment process to ensure responsible use.
- **Action Steps:**  
  - Refer to the [Ethical AI Checklist](./ethical_ai_checklist.md) for specific ethical practices.
  - Conduct regular ethical impact assessments to evaluate and mitigate potential risks.

## 8. Compliance
- **Practice:**  
  - Ensure all AI models comply with relevant laws, regulations, and organizational policies.
- **Action Steps:**  
  - Stay informed about legal requirements and industry standards related to AI.
  - Perform regular compliance audits to verify adherence to applicable guidelines.

## 9. Training and Awareness
- **Practice:**  
  - Provide ongoing training for team members involved in AI model development and deployment to keep them informed about best practices and emerging trends.
- **Action Steps:**  
  - Organize workshops and seminars on AI governance and ethics.
  - Encourage participation in relevant professional development opportunities.

## 10. Stakeholder Communication
- **Practice:**  
  - Maintain open lines of communication with stakeholders regarding AI model use, performance, and governance.
- **Action Steps:**  
  - Develop clear communication channels for stakeholder inquiries and feedback.
  - Provide regular updates on AI initiatives and governance practices to build trust and transparency.
